# facebook-html-export-exif-restore
bash script to restore EXIF timestamps on photos previously uploaded to Facebook.

## Warning: 
This script was generated by Claude.ai - I'm sharing it here as it worked for me (unlike some other tools out there that were hopelessly outdated or based around Facebook JSON exports)

Tested with an export from 2018. 

Place the bash script in your `photos_and_videos` folder and make sure to make it executable. On Unix-like OS systems, such as Linux and MacOS, this can be done with `chmod +x exif.sh`.

Then run the script using `./exif.sh`, optionally with the `-b` parameter if you need a backup. 

With a bit of luck, you'll see output like ths:
<img width="556" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3e4635-43d6-4fa8-a211-a337a15196c9" />


## Prerequisites:
You'll need both exiftool and python3:

exiftool: `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `brew install exiftool` (macOS)
python3: Should be pre-installed on most systems

Features:

Multi-language support: The parser handles Dutch and English dates. Untested with other languages.
Recursive search: Finds photos even if they're in subdirectories
HTML parsing: Extracts timestamps from the _2lem class divs in the HTML
Backup option: Use `-b` to create a backup before processing

The script will process both the main your_photos.html file and any album HTML files it finds, matching each photo to its timestamp and adding the appropriate EXIF data.
